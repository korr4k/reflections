How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
More rows = more precion on where the difference is located

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you 
do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Maybe some versions are just tests and you don't need to save them, manually saving allows you
to decide what is important and relevant for you.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one 
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is programmers oriented then usually more files are changed simultaneously if they are in
the same directory.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log tells us the id of each version, the autor and a note. Git diff uses the id of two dif-
ferent verions of the same file to compare the difference between them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break somet-
hing?
You can always go back to previus versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
My projects.
