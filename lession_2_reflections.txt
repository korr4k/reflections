What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates an hidden folder where the commits will be stored.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
Just by adding one file at a time with the add command.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
When you want to make personal changes in a group project or if the
changes are just only tests.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Thanks to arrows and common nodes.
